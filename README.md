### Abstract

There are no confirmed planets orbiting the binary star system of α Centauri AB. An investigation in the orbital stability of a hypothetical planet present in the binary was conducted by E. A. Popova and I. I. Shevchenko, whose relevant equations were derived. Their analysis pertained to the restricted and full three-body problems, respectively. The former refers to a third body inserted into the two-body problem which consists of no mass, while the latter has non-negligible mass. To further understand what is meant by a stable orbit, a discussion on the criteria behind stability was conducted. Such a discussion warranted an exploration of Lyapunov exponents, which “have the physical meaning of the mean rate of exponential divergence of close trajectories in the phase space of a dynamical system” [10].

### Introduction: α Centauri System

The α Centauri system of stars consists of a binary, comprised of α Centauri A and B, and a third star, Proxima Centauri [1]. The latter holds such a name for it being the closest of the three stars to our own Solar System, being approximately 10,000 AU closer to it than the binary. The system is 4.36 light years away, “or 41 million million km, in the direction of the southern constellation Centaurus” [1]. The binary stars orbit each other with a mutual eccentricity and semi-major axis of 0.5179 and 23.4 AU, respectively [15]. The orbital period is 79.91 years long [15]. 

There are no confirmed planets orbiting any of the stars in the binary. Remarkably, Proxima Centauri possesses 3 planets in its gravitational pull. The first planet discovered in the system was Proxima Centauri b, with a mass of 1.4 Earth masses, which lies in the habitable zone of the star [19]. Its orbital period is 11 days [21]. Proxima Centauri c was the second planet discovered, with a mass of approximately 12 Earth masses, comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, and it lies 1.5 AU away from its host star [8]. Most recently, Proxima Centauri d was discovered, being the lightest planet discovered with the radial velocity method of detecting exoplanets, with a minimum mass twice that of Mars, which is 0.26 Earth masses [5]. Its orbital period is 5.12 days long, resulting from the planet being immensely close to the star, at a distance of 0.02885 AU away [5]. This is well within the habitable zone [5].

The binary stars possess striking resemblances to the Sun, especially the primary star, α Centauri A. Their masses are 1.105 solar masses and 0.934 solar masses, respectively [15]. Given these similarities, the system serves as an excellent candidate to verify and test physical theories developed according to the behavior, composition, and structure of our Solar System [1]. The primary is a G2V spectral type star, while the secondary is a K1V star [1]. Proxima Centauri is a type M5.5V star [9]. These “spectral types” refer to a star’s spectral classification, where “a star’s spectrum contains information about the photosphere’s chemical composition and temperature” [16].
